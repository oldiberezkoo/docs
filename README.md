## Astro.docs 


This fork contains an unofficial Russian translation of the Astro documentation created for personal use.

- The **`master` branch** contains the Russian translation (currently ~90% complete).
- The **`main` branch** is intentionally kept close to the upstream repository and is used only for fast synchronization with the official `withastro/docs` repo.

This translation is not intended to be merged upstream and exists to provide a complete, consistent Russian version of the docs for local use and study.
